to read when each checker runs read the next file:
{source_dir}/tools/clang/include/clang/StaticAnalyzer/Core/CheckerManager.h

in addition read about the state that sval can be tracked 
{source_dir}/tools/clang/include/clang/StaticAnalyzer/Core/PathSensitive/SVals.h

currently 
- you need to have CC variable as your compiler (look at the makefile in the deadcode folder)
- you can't run the eclipse makefile cause it has explicit use of gcc and not CC variable.

to run static analysis on this folder file :
-  /opt/yehudas/workspace/misc_utils/compiler/llvm/tools/clang/tools/scan-build/scan-build --use-analyzer=/opt/yehudas/workspace/misc_utils/compiler/build/bin/clang  make
-  /opt/yehudas/workspace/misc_utils/compiler/llvm/tools/clang/tools/scan-view/scan-view /tmp/scan-build-2016-01-30-142326-42244-1

to run the analyzer with the clang
../../../debug_llvm/bin/clang --analyze ./test1.c -S
